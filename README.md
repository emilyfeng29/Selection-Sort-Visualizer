# Selection-Sort-Visualizer
## Algorithm Name 
Selection Sort Visualizer
## Demo video/gif/screenshot of test 
## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the four pillars of computational thinking  briefly in bullets) 
Decomposition 
- Generate a random list of integers
- Let the user input their sorted list
- Check correctness
- Play a sound for success or failure
- Visualize the selection sort step-by-step (show swaps and new minimums)

Pattern recognition 
- Finds the minimum in the unsorted part of the list
- Swaps it with the first unsorted element
- Moves the boundary between sorted and unsorted sublists

Abstraction
- Track current index and minimum
- Steps of the array state, check if user input is correct

Algorithmic thinking
- Input: user enters their sorted array
- Output: correct or incorrect based on the user's answer
- Constraints: input must be integers
